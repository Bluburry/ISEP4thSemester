# G003 - As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate / accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.

## 1. Context

This is the first time this task is assigned, but it will be visited in a later stage of the project.
At the moment, there is only one feature to be added that won't be used until the next sprint, so there isn't a method to show its use.
When it is, this document will be updated.

## 2. Requirements

**G003 -** As Project Manager, I want the team to configure the project structure to facilitate / accelerate the development of upcoming user stories.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

No acceptance criteria stated.

**Dependencies/References:**

* "Define the structure of the project to support the envisioned architecture, such as presented in Chapter 4, including support for adopted technologies (e.g., ANTLR)"

## 3. Analysis

The adopted technology implemented was the ANTLR. This installation was required to be done in every group member's computer.
This program will be later used in language related User Stories.

## 4. Design

This project doesn't have a specific file that uses the new configurations added with this task, so it isn't possible to represent the design, nor test can be created.
In a later stage of the project, this document will be updated with an example.

## 5. Implementation

This project doesn't have a specific file that uses the new configurations added with this task, so it isn't possible to represent the implementation.
In a later stage of the project, this document will be updated with an example.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

This project doesn't have a specific file that uses the new configurations added with this task, so it isn't possible to demonstrate it nor show how it interacts with the rest of the project.
In a later stage of the project, this document will be updated with an example.

## 7. Observations

Althought the refferences were met, since this will only be used in a later stage of the project, the team wasn't sure what more to add.

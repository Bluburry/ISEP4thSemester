# G002 - As Project Manager, I want the team to use the defined project repository (i.e., GitHub) and setup a tool for project management.

## 1. Context

This task is the first one being implemented, since it asks to setup the project repository. 
It doesn't have a direct presence in the project files, being mainly available in the GitHub website.
This task also includes the creation of individual files for each member, created through the available templates, that can be view through this project.

## 2. Requirements


**G002 -** As Project Manager, I want the team to use the defined project repository (i.e., GitHub) and setup a tool for project management.


**Acceptance Criteria:**

- G002.1. The team has to use the defined project repository.

- G002.2. The project management tool should be through GitHub (sugested by the teachers, but not enforced by the client).

**Dependencies/References:**

No dependencies nor references stated.

## 3. Analysis

To achieve the best method of team management and task distribution, the team decided to follow the SCRUM method of dividing each task through sprints
and the status of each task follow the format learned in previous years: *To-Do*, *In progress*, *Testing*, *Done*, with the addition of *Backlog* and *Blocked/Problems*.

Each task also has the priority, the completion time and the size of the workload.

## 4. Design

This task doesn't implement a specific functionality to the project, so it isn't possible to represent the design, nor test can be created.

## 5. Implementation

This task doesn't implement a specific functionality to the project, so it isn't possible to represent the implementation.

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

This task doesn't implement a specific functionality to the project, so it isn't possible to demonstrate it nor show how it interacts with the rest of the project.
## 7. Observations

None for this task.
